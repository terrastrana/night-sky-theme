night-sky-theme
===============

Celestial is a minimalist Tumblr theme using the night sky as an inspiration. A working example of the theme can be found at: http://night-sky-theme.tumblr.com.

Notes for Customizing the Theme: 
The image used in the sidebar was originally taken from the following link: http://www.wallconvert.com/wallpapers/photography/starry-sky-over-the-observatory-18232.html. The image has been included in the night-sky-theme repository for your convenience. (Please note that the sidebar will display a blank black box until a Sidebar Image has been uploaded.)

The header image used on the sample page was originally taken from the following link:
http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1414a/. The image has been included in the night-sky-theme repository for your convenience. (Please note that the Header Image setting is also optional. It will display as blank until you have uploaded a header image of your choice.)

The Background Image setting is optional, and will display as a tiled image if activated.

If you are new to customizing Twitter themes, I would recommend that you make a backup of your existing Tumblr theme,
before attempting to use this one.

Enjoy!
